The purpose of the EPICS in IEEE program is to further incorporate EPICS into IEEE worldwide, by *empowering* student branches and IEEE YP groups to work with *high school students* on EPICS *community* service-related *engineering* projects, and by institutionalizing the program within IEEE.
We aim to:

* establishement a relationship between the student branches in participating sections, a local high school (or schools), and *charitable*, *communal* or *humanitarian* organizations in each venue. 
* increase high school student *interest* in pursuing an engineering-related career path.
* develop of training workshops to train local section champions to establish an EPICS-site in their IEEE sections using local volunteers and resources.
