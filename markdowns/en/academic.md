IEEE Academic is:

* *dozens of teams from all over the world*: We have teams in several universities and schools from over 15 countries.
* *students and professors working together*: Students are involved at all levels of the project, and work side-by-side with their favorite professors to make sure videos are useful for students.
* *creating free educational multimedia materials*: Everything will be available to everyone, everwhere, using any device on the web, for free.
* *in their own languages, meeting their own needs*: We believe education is local, and content should be created locally, based on what is needed on the ground.
* *and inventing new tools for education*: We are pooling our experience as students, teachers, and researchers, to create new tools and new ways of teaching and learning.
