The Motivational Weekend is an event organized by IEEE-IST Student Branch for itâ€™s members where we rent a house for a weekend (two to three days) usually somewhere more isolated where we we can all *work exclusively* for our Student Branch.

Because this event is focused on our members, which are students, the price of the weekend is usually *low*.

The goals of the Motivational Weekend are:

* enhance the motivation of our members to work for our Student Branch.
* have fun, make new friends and decompress from our daily life.
