The IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society is the world's largest international society of biomedical engineers.
In 2014, we founded EMBS at IEEE-IST Student Branch as a result of the growth of bioengineering.

We *aim* to:

* Actively participate in the *bioengineering community*.
* Organize *events and activities*, in order to spread knowledge, ideas and opinions related to this area.
