TISP 2.0 initiative has the goal of bringing the engineering world to high school students and motivate them with several *hands-on activities*. 
Students are inspired and enforced to use their problem solving abilities, awakening their engineering spirit.

TISP 2.0 is a competition that encourages students to reinforce their experimental and theoretical capabilities while theyâ€™re at the same time developing *team spirit and creativity*.

The different activities, that make up this *competition*, aim to put students closer to situations that they will encounter in case of choosing a vocational pathway linked to engineering.
