The IEEE-IST Robotics and Automation Society was created in 2013 with the goal of giving students *hands-on experiences* and real practice in our field of activity.
On these years of activity we sought to:

* promote robotics and electronics related activities such as *workshops*, *competitions* and even a *hacker group*.
* join our forces with *N3E* (ISTâ€™s Electronics Students Association) to build a better team, a better workspace and, together, reach higher goals.
